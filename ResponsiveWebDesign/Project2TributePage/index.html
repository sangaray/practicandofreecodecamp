          Acclaimed actor Alan Rickman who left us too soon in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. Rickman came from a
          working-class background and considered acting and drama school too impractical a choice as a career. He
          excelled in art and painting as a teen which led to him studying at the Royal Academy of Art and later
          starting his own design firm. At the age of 26 he decided to change course and applied to the Royal Academy of
          Dramatic Arts to which he was accepted. Upon graduation Rickman began working steadily on the British stage.
          While he played a variety of roles it wouldn’t be until about a decade later that he would find the role that
          would gain him huge attention in both London and the US. That role would be as Valmont in the Royal
          Shakespeare Company’s production of “Les Liaisons Dangereuses.” He played the role in London and then again on
          Broadway where he earned a Tony nomination in 1987. The success of that production would inspire two movie
          versions of the same story to be made in the coming years but neither would star Rickman. In 1988 John
          Malkovich played the role in “Dangerous Liaisons” and the following year Colin Firth would play the part in
          “Valmont.” Despite being passed over for those film versions, Rickman still managed to be noticed by Hollywood
          and was given a key role in the action blockbuster “Die Hard” in 1988. He would work steadily in all mediums
          until his death. In 2002 he won a Tony on Broadway for a revival of “Private Lives.” In 1991 he won a BAFTA
          for his performance in “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.” The year 1996 saw Rickman sweep all the major
          television awards (Emmy, Golden Globe and SAG) as Best Supporting Actor in the TV movie “Rasputin: Dark
          Servant of Destiny.” Tour our photo gallery of his 10 greatest film performances, ranked worst to best. Our
          list includes “Die Hard,” plus the “Harry Potter” series, “Truly Madly Deeply,” “Love Actually” and more.

        <h2 class="films" id="films">Alan Rickman's 10 Best Movies</h2>
        <h3>Eye In The Sky (2015)</h3>
        <p>
          Eye in the Sky was the last live-action movie to feature Alan Rickman, and it was worthy of being his final
          role. The actor played Lieutenant General Frank Benson, a key character in the high-stakes operation aimed at
          capturing terrorists in Kenya. The movie offered a fresh take on political action thrillers about impossible
          choices, and Rickman was a perfect addition to the star-studded ensemble. The late actor played Benson as if
          he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and his final scene was a whirlwind of emotions that
          should've earned Rickman a posthumous Academy Award.
        </p>
        <h3>Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990)</h3>
        <p>
          Truly, Madly, Deeply should've been a bigger hit, but it had the most unfortunate timing, as Ghost was
          released in the same year to a much greater success. Nina struggled with grief over the death of her
          boyfriend, Jamie, but he suddenly returned to her in a ghost form to help her move on with her life. It was an
          unusual role for Alan Rickman, but his effortlessly realistic approach earned him a BAFTA nomination for Best
          Actor. His Jamie, albeit a ghost, was a flawed but lovable human being, and that was what made the movie so
          riveting.
