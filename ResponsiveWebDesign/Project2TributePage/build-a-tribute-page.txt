        <h2 class="bio" id="bio">Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Acclaimed actor Alan Rickman who left us too soon in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. Rickman came from a
          working-class background and considered acting and drama school too impractical a choice as a career. He
          excelled in art and painting as a teen which led to him studying at the Royal Academy of Art and later
          starting his own design firm. At the age of 26 he decided to change course and applied to the Royal Academy of
          Dramatic Arts to which he was accepted. Upon graduation Rickman began working steadily on the British stage.
          While he played a variety of roles it wouldn’t be until about a decade later that he would find the role that
          would gain him huge attention in both London and the US. That role would be as Valmont in the Royal
          Shakespeare Company’s production of “Les Liaisons Dangereuses.” He played the role in London and then again on
          Broadway where he earned a Tony nomination in 1987. The success of that production would inspire two movie
          versions of the same story to be made in the coming years but neither would star Rickman. In 1988 John
          Malkovich played the role in “Dangerous Liaisons” and the following year Colin Firth would play the part in
          “Valmont.” Despite being passed over for those film versions, Rickman still managed to be noticed by Hollywood
          and was given a key role in the action blockbuster “Die Hard” in 1988. He would work steadily in all mediums
          until his death. In 2002 he won a Tony on Broadway for a revival of “Private Lives.” In 1991 he won a BAFTA
          for his performance in “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.” The year 1996 saw Rickman sweep all the major
          television awards (Emmy, Golden Globe and SAG) as Best Supporting Actor in the TV movie “Rasputin: Dark
          Servant of Destiny.” Tour our photo gallery of his 10 greatest film performances, ranked worst to best. Our
          list includes “Die Hard,” plus the “Harry Potter” series, “Truly Madly Deeply,” “Love Actually” and more.

        <h2 class="films" id="films">Alan Rickman's Best Movies</h2>
        <h3>Harry Potter Sagaa (2001-2011)</h3>
        <p>
          Rickman had a central role in this the first of the Harry Potter films and he would go on to appear in the
          rest of the series. The books by J.K. Rowling caused a publishing sensation with its tale of a young wizard
          training to use his craft at an academy that teaches wizardly. Rickman plays Severus Snape a teacher at the
          Hogwarts Academy whom Harry often clashes with and openly dislikes. As the series progresses Harry learns to
          have a different view of who Snape is and why he behaves the way he does.
        </p>
        <h3>Eye In The Sky (2015)</h3>
        <p>
          Eye in the Sky was the last live-action movie to feature Alan Rickman, and it was worthy of being his final
          role. The actor played Lieutenant General Frank Benson, a key character in the high-stakes operation aimed at
          capturing terrorists in Kenya. The movie offered a fresh take on political action thrillers about impossible
          choices, and Rickman was a perfect addition to the star-studded ensemble. The late actor played Benson as if
          he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and his final scene was a whirlwind of emotions that
          should've earned Rickman a posthumous Academy Award.
        </p>
        <h3>Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990)</h3>
        <p>
          Truly, Madly, Deeply should've been a bigger hit, but it had the most unfortunate timing, as Ghost was
          released in the same year to a much greater success. Nina struggled with grief over the death of her
          boyfriend, Jamie, but he suddenly returned to her in a ghost form to help her move on with her life. It was an
          unusual role for Alan Rickman, but his effortlessly realistic approach earned him a BAFTA nomination for Best
          Actor. His Jamie, albeit a ghost, was a flawed but lovable human being, and that was what made the movie so
          riveting.
        </p>
        <h3>Love Actually (2003)</h3>
        <p>
          It is impossible to rewatch Love Actually without acknowledging its harsh realities, and the journey of Alan
          Rickman's character is one of those realities. The actor played Harry, a married man who had an emotional
          affair with his subordinate, Mia. The movie wonderfully interwove its multiple love stories, and the subplot
          with Harry and Karen, played by Rickman's longtime on-screen partner Emma Thompson, was one of heartbreak.
          Even though Harry turned out to be a cheater, there was something infinitely appealing about him — and that
          was all thanks to Rickman's own charisma.
        </p>
        <h3>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (2007)</h3>
        <p>
          Alan Rickman's character in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was easily one of his most
          legendary villainous roles. His Judge Turpin took away Sweeney Todd's wife and had him locked up, forcing Todd
          to reinvent himself as a vengeful barber who set on a quest to make the world pay. Turpin was horrendously
          disgusting, and Rickman masterfully brought him to life on screen by honoring the character's legacy and
          adding his take on the villain at the same time. The star was always great at portraying monsters, and this
          one was no exception.
        </p>
        <h3>Sense And Sensibility (1995)</h3>
        <p>
          Sense and Sensibility had immense star power, which resulted in many prestigious nominations and awards — Alan
          Rickman received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and rightfully so. In this Jane Austen
          adaptation, the star played the reserved Colonel Brandon, Marianne Dashwood's love interest. It was one of
          Rickman's most passionate and emotional roles. Despite the fact that his character appeared to be on the
          quieter side, the actor managed to depict his deep love for Marianne through tiny smiles and affectionate
          stares. Sense and Sensibility demonstrated Rickman's dramatic talent to the fullest.
        </p>
        <h3>Die Hard (1988)</h3>
        <p>
          Die Hard breathed a second life into the action thriller genre, quickly becoming a cult classic. The film made
          its leading men, Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman, international stars, as they both created uniquely appealing
          characters that were fascinating to watch on screen. Rickman's Hans Gruber was the perfect opposite for
          Willis' John McClane, and he made the villain so elegant and vicious at the same time that it was difficult to
          believe that Die Hard was the actor's first film job. Rickman showed Hollywood what he was capable of with
          this role, but he kept exceeding expectations long after.
        </p>
        <h3>Michael Collins (1996)</h3>
        <p>
          Rickman received another Best Supporting Actor nomination from BAFTA for this historical drama about Michael
          Collins who was a key figure in the Irish Revolution and launched a guerilla style war against the United
          Kingdom. Rickman played Irish politician Éamon de Valera and once again walked off with better reviews for the
          film than those of the film’s starry leads.
        </p>
        <h3>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)</h3>
        <p>
          This version of the popular Robin Hood legend did well at the box office but was trashed a bit by critics.
          This was Kevin Costner’s follow up to his film “Dances with Wolves” which swept the prior year’s Oscars
          winning seven awards including Best Picture and Director for Costner. Costner got a lot of flack for this film
          about his inconsistent British accent. Rickman walked off with the best reviews for the film as the evil
          Sheriff of Nottingham. His acclaim was such that it won him the BAFTA award as Best Supporting Actor for this
          film.
        </p>
        <h3>The Butler (2013)</h3>
        <p>
          “The Butler” tells the true-life story of an African American man who serves as a butler in the White House
          under eight different US Presidents starting with Dwight D. Eisenhower in the fifties through Ronald Reagan in
          the eighties. The man witnesses history first hand and only resigns his post when Reagan refuses to support
          sanctions against South Africa during apartheid. Rickman played Reagan in a transformative performance and
          close impersonation.
